## Cambridge One Liners

# Motivation

Motivation is clearly procrastination but while doing that we can be useful to each other and possibly to next years. I plan to gather here useful scripts that might make our lives a little easier (I know it is a long shot).

It says Cambridge One Liners but I'm okay with scripts of any length.

# Want to contribute?

As mentioned the script does not have to be a one liner but I am not expecting anyone to submit a 500 lines long program.

The organization is simple program should be inside the folder that has the name of the language used.

If it is a one liner than put it in one liners document if not put it in a folder with descriptive name.

If it is a one liner please write a small comment on top explaining what it does.

I'll be waiting for pull requests!
